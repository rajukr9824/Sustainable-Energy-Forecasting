The integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in buildings presents both opportunities and challenges in energy management. While on-site generation reduces dependence on grid power, the variability in solar output necessitates accurate net energy demand forecasting for optimizing building operations and supporting the smart grid. This project addresses the need for intelligent forecasting systems capable of accounting for both consumption and renewable generation dynamics.
Traditional load forecasting focuses solely on consumption, neglecting the impact of renewable sources like solar. The goal of this project is to predict net energy demand:
Net Demand = Total Consumption - Solar Generation
This forecasting helps in:
●	Efficient scheduling of HVAC and battery storage systems.
●	Minimizing grid import/export costs.
●	Enhancing demand response strategies.
